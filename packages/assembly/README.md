## Usage

To use the `@as-pect/assembly` package, typically, it's best to use the
`@as-pect/cli` package to output a binary using `--outputBinary`. However
in the case of generating the binary manually, it's possible to use the
following AssemblyScript `asc` cli options:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD040 -->

```
asc entry.ts ./node_modules/@as-pect/assembly/assembly/index.ts \
  --use ASC_RTRACE=1 \
  --explicitStart \
  --transform ./node_modules/@as-pect/core/lib/transform/index.ts
```

This will compile the binary with all of the required `as-pect` setup functions.

## Comparisons

There are a set of comparison functions defined in the `types/as-pect.d.ts` types
definition. These comparison functions allow you to inspect object and memory
state.

### toBe

This comparison is used for comparing data using the `==` operator. In
AssemblyScript this operator is used for comparing strings, numbers, and exact
reference equality (or pointer comparison.)

For example, the following statements are valid `toBe` assertions:

```ts
let a = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
expect<Vec3>(a).toBe(a);
expect<i32>(10).toBe(10);
expect<Vec3>(null).toBe(null);
```

This method is safe to use portably with `jest`.

### toStrictEqual

This method performs a single `memory.compare()` on two blocks of data. This is
useful for references and strings. For example, using a `toBe()` assertion on
two different references results in a failed assertion:

```ts
let a = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
let b = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
expect<Vec3>(a).toBe(b); // fails!
```

Instead, it's posible to compare two different references like this:

```ts
expect<Vec3>(a).toStrictEqual(b); // passes!
```

The following snippet an approximate the JavaScript equivalent for the
`toStrictEqual` comparison:

```ts
// loop over each property (properties are the same at compile time)
for (let prop in a) {
  if (a[prop] === b[prop]) {
    // exact equality check
    continue;
  } else {
    assert(negated);
  }
}
assert(!negated);
```

If the object has child references, like strings or pointers to other blocks
of memory, the comparison will fail because the pointers are different. This
happens because `as-pect` cannot perform object traversal. Instead, a custom
method should be used to traverse child references to compare equality.

The `toStrictEqual` comparison, however, does perform a `==` comparison before
opting into using a full memory comparison. If the `@operator("==")` is
overridden, then it's possible for two references to be compared using this
method:

```ts
class Vec3 {
  constructor(public a: f64 = 0.0, public b: f64 = 0.0, public c: f64 = 0.0) {}

  // override the operator
  @operator("==")
  protected __equals(ref: Vec3 | null): bool {
    return (
      this === ref ||
      (this !== null &&
        ref !== null &&
        this.a == ref.a &&
        this.b == ref.b &&
        this.c == ref.c)
    );
  }
}
```

This method is _not_ safe to use portably with `jest` yet. Once `Reflection`
is supported by AssemblyScript, `as-pect` will support compatibility
between `jest`'s version of this function.

### toBlockEqual

This comparison is the same comparison used on `ArrayBuffer` and `String`s.
It compares the bytes of the heap allocations by obtaining the exact size
of the block and then performing a memcompare if the `actual` and `expected`
blocks match.

Only use this comparison when comparing `ArrayBuffer` references.

```ts
let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(100); // 100 bytes long heap allocation
let buffer2 = new ArrayBuffer(100); // another buffer

expect<ArrayBuffer>(buffer).toBlockEqual(buffer2);
```

### toBeTruthy and toBeFalsy

These comparisons are used to determine if a value is truthy or falsy in the
JavaScript sense. In JavaScript there are only six falsy values:

- `false`
- `0`
- `""`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`

In AssemblyScript, there is no `undefined`, so `as-pect` will treat each of
those values as falsy. Truthy values are anything that is not falsy,

```ts
expect<bool>(true).toBeTruthy();
expect<Vec3>(new Vec3(1, 2, 3)).toBeTruthy();
expect<i32>(1).toBeTruthy();
expect<string>("Something!").toBeTruthy();
expect<bool>(false).toBeFalsy();
expect<Vec3>(null).toBeFalsy();
expect<i32>(0).toBeFalsy();
expect<f64>(NaN).toBeFalsy();
expect<string>("").toBeFalsy();
```

These methods are safe to use with `jest`.

### toBeNaN

This comparison is only used for float values to determine if the value is a
`NaN` value.

```ts
expect<f32>(NaN).toBeNaN(); // passes
expect<f64>(1.0).not.toBeNaN(); // passes

/** This results in a runtime error, despite not being NaN. */
expect<Vec3>(new Vec3()).not.toBeNaN();
```

If this method is called with anything other than a `f32 | f64` type, it will
result in a compile time error.

This method is safe to use with `jest` portably.

### toBeNull

This comparison looks specifically for a `null` value.

```ts
expect<Vec3>(null).toBeNull(); // valid assertion
```

In the case of numeric values, numbers cannot be `null` in AssemblyScript, thus,
if this method is called with anything other than a reference type, this will
result in a compile time error.

This method is safe to use with `jest` portably.

### toBeFinite

This comparison is used to detect if float values are finite. The following
values are not finite in JavaScript or AssemblyScript.

- `Infinity`
- `-Infinity`
- `NaN`

The following assertions are true.

```ts
expect<f64>(1.0).toBeFinite();
expect<f32>(Infinity).not.toBeFinite();
expect<f64>(NaN).not.toBeFinite();
```

As long as the number values are always `f32` or `f64` (or `number` in
JavaScript or AssemblyScript,) `toBeFinite` is a safe assertion to use
portably with jest.

If this method is called without a float without a float value type, it
will result in a compile time error.

### toThrow

This comparison is used to test and see if a function throws an error. In the
case of AssemblyScript and `as-pect`, the function will be called from within
a JavaScript `try` block, and if the function throws, the assertion is valid,
unless it is negated with the `not` property.

```ts
expect(() => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).toThrow();
```

Closure is not supported in AssemblyScript yet. Also, any references that are
left dangling on the stack will hang around un`__release()`ed by
AssemblyScript.

If this function is used on anything other than a `() => void` function type,
it will result in a compile time error.

This function is safe to use with `jest`.

### toBeGreaterThan and toBeLessThan

This set of comparisons validate that a value is greater than, less than, or
equal to another value. The following assertions are true.

```ts
expect<i32>(100).toBeGreaterThan(42);
expect<i32>(0).toBeLessThan(100);
expect<i32>(0).not.toBeGreaterThan(100);
expect<f64>(1.0).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1.0);
expect<f64>(1.0).not.toBeLessThanOrEqual(0);
```

These assertions also work with reference types when the
`@operator(">" | "<" | ">=" | "<=")` is used on a method in the class.

```ts
class Vec3 {
  constructor(public x: f64 = 0.0, public y: f64 = 0.0, public z: f64 = 0.0) {}

  @operator(">")
  protected __gt(other: Vec3): bool {
    return (
      this.x * this.x + this.y * this.y + this.z * this.z >
      other.x * other.x + other.y * other.y + other.z * other.z
    );
  }
}

// valid assertion because `@operator` was overloaded
expect<Vec3>(new Vec3(1, 2, 3)).toBeGreaterThan(new Vec3(0, 0, 0));
```

These methods are safe to use portably with `jest`, provided they aren't used
with reference types.

### toBeCloseTo

When doing floating point math, it's possible that values will not be exactly as
expected because of floating point error.

```ts
expect<f64>(0.1 + 0.2).toBe(0.3); // fails

> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
```

Instead, use `expect().toBeCloseTo()` to validate an expected floating point
value.

```ts
expect<f64>(0.1 + 0.2).toBeCloseTo(0.3); // passes!
```

Reference values and integer values will result in a runtime error, because
`toBeCloseTo` comparisons require a floating point number to work.

if this method is called on anything other than a `f64 | f32` type, it will
result it a compile time error.

This method is safe to use portably with `jest`.

### toHaveLength

This comparison verifies the length of a given object. This includes Arrays,
TypedArrays, ArrayBuffers, and custom classes that have a `length` property.

```ts
class LengthExample {
  constructor(public length: i32 = 0) {}
}

const array = new Array<Vec3>(100);
const typedarray = new Uint8Array(42);
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(29);
const custom = new LengthExample(50);

expect<Array<Vec3>>(array).toHaveLength(100);
expect<Uint8Array>(typedarray).toHaveLength(42);
expect<ArrayBuffer>(buffer).toHaveLength(29);
expect<LengthExample>(custom).toHaveLength(50);
```

If this method is used with anything other than a reference type, it will result
in a compile time error.

This method is safe to use with `jest`, with the exception of using
`ArrayBuffer` type references.

### toContain and toInclude

This comparison is used to determine if an Array contains a value.

All the values returned by `T[index]` will be compared using the `==` operator,
so overloading the class `@operator("==")` can be used in conjunction with this
comparison. The `index` must be a number value, and there must be a `length`
property that matches the `index` type. All values from `0` to `length - 1`
will be checked.

```ts
const data = new Uint8Array(100);
data[5] = 255;

expect<Uint8Array>(data).toContain(255);
```

This method is portable with `jest` using the `toContain()` method.

### toContainEqual and toIncludeEqual

This comparison is used to determine if an Array contains a reference that
equals another reference.

All the values returned by `T[index]` will be compared using the `==` operator,
and if that comparison does not work, a memcompare will be used. Overloading the
class `@operator("==")` can be used in conjunction with this comparison. The
`index` must be a number value, and there must be a `length` property that
matches the `index` type. All values from `0` to `length - 1` will be checked.

```ts
const reference = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
const data = new Array<Vec3>(0);
data.push(new Vec(0, 0, 0));
data.push(new Vec(1, 2, 3));
data.push(new Vec(4, 5, 6));

expect<Uint8Array>(data).toContainEqual(referece);
```

This method is portable with `jest` using the `toContainEqual()` method.

## Custom Assertions

In order to write a custom assertion that is compatible with `as-pect` output,
an `Actual` and `Expected` namespace is provided. For example, we can write a
custom assertion like this:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```ts
function expectToBeEven(
  value: i32,
  negated: bool = false,
  message: string = null,
): void {
  Actual.report<i32>(value);
  Expected.report<string>("Even", i32(negated));

  // check if the first bit is 0
  let isEven = (value & 1) == 0;
  // use exclusive or to determine if the assertion passes
  assert(i32(isEven) ^ i32(negated), message);
  // dont forget to clear the value
  Actual.clear();
  Expected.clear();
}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## Types And Tooling

The `as-pect` assembly comes with a way to generate the types for all the globals
used by the framework. This will greatly increase your productivity because it
comes with lots of documentation, and adds a lot of intellisense to your
development experience.

It is also possible to reference the types manually. Use the following
reference at the top of your `assembly/index.ts` file to include these types
in your project automatically. If you use this method for your types, feel
free to delete the auto-generated types file in your test folder.

```ts
/// <reference path="../node_modules/@as-pect/core/types/as-pect.d.ts" />
/// <reference path="../node_modules/@as-pect/core/types/as-pect.portable.d.ts" />
```

## AssemblyScript Compiler Options

In general the best way to use the `as-pect` testing suite to compile your
tests to Wasm is to use the `asp` cli option `--outputBinary`. This will compile
every test and output binary files for each test that matches the `include`
property in the `as-pect.config.js` file.

In order to compile the test binary correctly, the
`@as-pect/assembly/assembly/index.ts` file must be included as an entry point.
Also, `--use ASC_RTRACE=1` is required in order to enable RTrace error reporting
and reference counting statistics. Finally, the `--explicitStart` flag must be
passed to the compiler to enable proper test name and group name collection since
`as-pect` will call the `wasm.__start()` method manually after the loader is
instantiated. The following example can be used to help manually compile `as-pect`
tests.

```
asc {testentry.ts} node_modules/@as-pect/assembly/assembly/index.ts \
  --use ASC_RTRACE=1 \
  --explicitStart \
  --binaryFile {testentry.wasm} \
  --textFile {testentry.wat}
```

## Closures

AssemblyScript currently does not support closures around local scopes, only
around the global scope. However, you can place all relevant tests and setup
function calls for a test suite into a corresponding `describe` block after
declaring a global variable.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```ts
import { Vec3 } from "./setup/Vec3";

// setup a global vector reference
var vec: Vec3;

describe("vectors", () => {
  // this runs before each test function, and must be placed within the describe function
  beforeEach(() => {
    // create a new vector for each test
    vec = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
  });

  // this runs after each test function, and must be placed within the describe function
  afterEach(() => {
    vec = null; // free the vector
  });

  // use `test()` or `it()` to run a test
  test("vec should not be null", () => {
    // write an expectation
    expect<Vec3>(vec).not.toBeNull();
  });
});
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Nested `describe` blocks are supported and the outer describe should be
evaluated first.

```ts
describe("vector", () => {
  // this test block runs first
  it("should run first", () => {});

  describe("addition", () => {
    // this test block runs second
    it("should add vectors together", () => {
      expect<Vec3>(vec1.add(vec2)).toStrictEqual(new Vec3(1, 2, 3));
    });
  });
});
```

## Expectations

Calling the `expect<T>(value: T)` function outside of the following functions
will result in unexpected behavior:

- `beforeEach()`
- `afterEach()`
- `beforeAll()`
- `afterAll()`
- `test()`
- `it()`
- `throws()`
- `itThrows()`

If this happens, the entire test suite will fail before it runs in the CLI, and
the error description will be reported to the console.

## Logging

A global `log<T>(value: T): void` function is provided by `as-pect` to help
collect useful information about the state of your program. Simply give it
the type you want to log, and it will append a `LogValue` item to the
corresponding `TestResult` or `TestGroup` item the `log()` function was
called within.

```ts
log<string>("This will log a string"); // Remember, strings are references
log<f64>(0.4); // this logs a float value
log<i32>(42); // this logs the meaning of life
log<Vec3>(new Vec3(1, 2, 3)); // this logs every byte in the reference
log<i32[]>([1, 2, 3]); // this will log an array
```

This log function does _not_ pipe the output to stdout. It simply attaches the
log value to the current group or test the `log()` function was called in. Then
the after the test runs the configured `Reporter` decides if it is piped to
stdout, which is what `DefaultTestReporter` does.
