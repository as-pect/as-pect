# Agent TODO — active maintenance slices

Verified: June 14, 2026

Only valid positive work that needs to be done should exist in this file. In practice: keep this file limited to actionable, still-active improvement or repair work; remove completed, obsolete, speculative, or purely historical notes. Each slice is intended to be small, atomic, and reviewable on its own.

## Ground rules for agents

- Keep each slice focused; do not bundle unrelated reporter, snapshot, lifecycle, or benchmark changes.
- Prefer tests before fixes when the current behavior is unclear.
- Avoid new dependencies unless the slice explicitly justifies them. Benchmarks should use Node built-ins first.
- Run focused package tests for the package touched, then run broader validation when the slice changes shared behavior.
- Link every slice to exactly one epic. If a slice appears to belong to multiple epics, split it.
- Preserve compatibility for existing users unless the slice explicitly says it is a compatibility migration slice.
- When a slice creates a new project concept, update `CONTEXT.md` in the same change.

## TODO hygiene checklist

When updating this file after a maintenance change:

- Remove completed slices instead of leaving historical status notes in the active list.
- Split broad slices when the next useful review boundary is smaller than the current description.
- Keep one epic link per slice, and move cross-epic follow-up into a separate slice.
- Add or update validation notes so the next agent can run the smallest command that proves the work.
- Re-check hidden work in epic prose; convert it into explicit slices or delete it if it is obsolete.

No active maintenance slices remain.
